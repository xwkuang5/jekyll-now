+++
This project was done during my final year at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](www.cuhk.edu.hk/) as my final year project. 

I developed a distributed sparse support vector machine algorithm ([code](https://github.com/xwkuang5/husky/blob/fyp/examples/dfgm.cpp)) for feature selection. The algorithm was implemented on [Husky](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/proj-h/index.html) (A general distributed computing system developed at CUHK). The proposed algorithm is capable of handling large scale high dimensional datasets.
